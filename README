Foreman Discovery Image
=======================

This is a small redhat-based image that boots via PXE into memory,
initializes all network interfaces using NetworkManager and spawns small
script called "discover-host" via systemd. This script determines foreman
URL either via DNS SRV or via kernel command line and uploads facts via
Foreman Discovery plugin API.

The image has foreman-proxy installed with BMC API configured to "shell"
provider. Upon request of Foreman, it reboots the node via /usr/bin/reboot
command. To initiate the restart, use the following command:

  curl -3 -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Length:0" -k -X PUT \
    http://192.168.100.100:8443/bmc/ignored/chassis/power/cycle

Usage
-----

The full installation and setup is described on the foreman_discovery
plugin site: https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery

Once you extract the tarball into /var/lib/tftpboot/boot directory, the most
important part is the PXELinux configuration in the Foreman application.

Make sure the APPEND statement is on the *single line*.


Planned features
----------------

* Possibility to download additional packages (ZIP files) with extra
  content.
* Remote firmware upgrade.
* Remote OS image deployment.

Building
--------

To prepare CentOS 7 kickstart do:

  $ ./build-livecd fdi-centos7.ks

To prepare Fedora 19 kickstart do:

  $ ./build-livecd fdi-fedora19.ks

To build the image (make sure you have at least 1 GB free space in /tmp):

  $ sudo ./build-livecd-root

Copy the resulting tarball to the TFTP boot directory:

  $ tar xvf fdi-image-*.tar -C /var/tftproot/boot

And visit https://github.com/theforeman/foreman_discovery for more
information about how to configure Foreman and how to use the plugin.

The image is built in /tmp directory because in most modern distributions
this is mapped to memory. This is intentional, so make sure you have enough
RAM or you can experience some swapping. Alternatively, change the temp
directory in the scripts.

Additional facts
----------------

Some extra facts are reported in addition to the standard ones reported by
Facter:

  FACTERLIB=/usr/share/fdi/facts/ facter | grep discovery
  discovery_bootif => 52:54:00:94:9e:52
  discovery_bootip => 192.168.122.51

discovery_bootif - MAC of the interface it was booted from
discovery_bootip - IP of the interface it was booted from

Troubleshooting
---------------

First of all make sure your server (or VM) has more than 500 MB of memory
because less memory can lead to various random kernel panic errors as the
image needs to be extracted in-place (150 MB * 2).

The first virtual console is reserved for logs, all systemd logging is
shown there. Particulary useful system logs are tagged with:

  * discover-host - initial facts upload
  * foreman-discovery - facts refresh, reboot remote commands
  * nm-prepare - boot script which pre-configures NetworkManager
  * NetworkManager - networking information

The root account and ssh access are disabled by default, but you can enable
ssh and set root password using the following kernel command line options:

  fdi.ssh=1 fdi.rootpw=redhat

You can use tty2 console (or higher) to login as well.

Downstream
----------

This repostirory is downstream friendly for koji. The generated
fdi-image.ks kickstart file is self-containing. First of all, run the
initial script and provide empty base kickstart without any repositories
(they will be added via koji:

  $ ./build-livecd fdi-empty.ks

Then simply build the image from kickstart called fdi-image.ks:

  koji spin-livecd \
    fdi-image-rhel_7_0 \
    $(cat root/usr/share/fdi/VERSION) \
    --release $(cat root/usr/share/fdi/RELEASE) \
    --repo=http://my.repo/1 \
    --scratch \
    my-tag-image
    x86_64 \
    fdi-image.ks

Then extract the kernel and initial RAM disk:

  mv fdi-image-rhel_7_0-1.9.90-20141022.1.iso fdi.iso
  livecd-iso-to-pxeboot fdi.iso
