# Simple bash script to check for and start the downloaded extension(s)

# Since we allow multiple zipfile extensions, we require users to put
# autostart scripts in autostart.d, which will then be executed in
# POSIX order, in blocking mode so that they can complete before the
# host is registered. Users are responsible for backgrounding long tasks
# in their own startup scripts.

    test -x "$script" && $script
