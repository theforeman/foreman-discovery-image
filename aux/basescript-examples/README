Example scripts which can be run from kernel commandline. To encode them do:

# cat aux/basescript-examples/myscript | gzip -9 | base64 -w0
fdi.script=H4sIAK4hZ1oCA0tNzshXUA/JyCxWAKJEhZLU4hJ1LgA92U9qFgAAAA==

And append. Keep in mind that kernel command line length is very limited.

There are couple of helper shell functions which can be used defined in:

  root/usr/bin/discovery-script

Send patches with more functions for more options.
